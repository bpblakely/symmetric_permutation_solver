Theorems based on Contemporary Abstract Algebra SEVENTH EDITION by Joseph A. Gallian

## Requires either CPython/PyPy 3.6, Python 3.7, or higher

# Tips
* Not a programmer?
  * Use an online Python compiler (Python 3.7 or higher) run this code quickly and easily

# To Do

* Expand input selection to accept non-cycle inputs
* Test for accuracy with a large dataset
* Optimize for larger n values (Sn grows factorially)
* Set up a simple website to make it easy to run and interface
* Create methods to return specific results (the order, parity, inverse, ect.)
  * Interface these methods with a simple button, so it's easy to use
